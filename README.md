## Why Where?

File Explorer shows you **where a file is**. Where shows you **everything
about a piece of work**: its files, tasks, notes and links, in one search.

| You want to… | File Explorer | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Find a file by name | ✅ | ✅ |
| See the tasks and notes that go with a folder | ❌ | ✅ |
| Search "website login" and get the task, the note *and* the code folder | ❌ | ✅ |
| Find something without remembering which app or folder it's in | ❌ | ✅ |
| Keep everything offline and private | ✅ | ✅ |

Where doesn't replace your apps or move your files. It sits on top of them and
connects them. It isn't the first tool to link notes and projects
(Notion, Capacities and Anytype do too); what's different is combining that
with **your real files**, fully offline. See
[the spec](docs/SPEC.md#33-competitive-landscape) for the honest comparison.

## Features

- **Search everything as you type.** Results are grouped by kind with the
  matching words highlighted, and search follows connections:
  *"website authentication"* finds the task *Fix Firebase authentication*
  because it's inside the *Website* project.
- **Projects** collect tasks, notes and folders, with a progress bar.
- **Tasks** with checkboxes, *In progress* status and filters.
- **Notes** that save as you type and can belong to a project.
- **Links** from your browser: click the Where button (or Alt+Shift+W) on
  any page to save it with a title, a note and a project. Addresses are
  clickable and searchable. [Browser extension →](browser-extension/)
- **Files**: index only the folders you choose. Where never moves,
  changes or uploads your files.
- **Ctrl K** for quick actions: create, jump anywhere, index, export,
  switch theme.
- **Privacy panel** that shows exactly what Where stores. Sync, AI and
  activity tracking are all off.
- **Export everything** to JSON, Markdown, CSV or a database copy.
- Light and dark themes, full keyboard control, subtle animations.

## Download

Get the file for your computer from the
[latest release](https://github.com/ItsJeffTheDev/Where/releases/latest):

| Your computer | Download | Then |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** 10 / 11 | `Where-Setup-…-windows-x64.exe` | Run it. Where is added to the Start menu. |
| Windows, no install | `Where-…-windows-x64-portable.zip` | Unzip, run `Where.exe` |
| **Mac** (Apple Silicon or Intel) | `Where-…-macos-universal.dmg` | Open it, drag Where to Applications |
| **Linux** (any distro) | `Where-…-linux-x64.AppImage` | `chmod +x` the file, then run it |
| Ubuntu / Debian / Mint | `Where-…-linux-x64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./Where-…-linux-x64.deb` |
| Linux on ARM | `…-linux-arm64.AppImage` or `.deb` | Same as above |

These builds aren't signed yet. The first time: on Windows click
**More info → Run anyway**; on a Mac right-click Where → **Open**.

## Build it yourself

The setup script works out which computer it's on — Windows, Mac or Linux,
Intel/AMD or ARM — installs anything missing, builds the right app for it,
and opens Where.

| Your computer | Run | You get |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | double-click **`start-where.bat`** | `Where.exe`, plus Desktop and Start menu shortcuts |
| **Mac** | double-click **`start-where.command`** | `Where.app` in `~/Applications` (Launchpad, Spotlight) |
| **Linux** | `bash start-where.sh` in a terminal | `Where`, added to your applications menu |

What gets installed if it's missing:

- **Windows:** Git, Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, Rust, Flutter. Turn on
  **Developer Mode** when asked.
- **Mac:** Xcode from the App Store (the script opens it for you — install
  and open it once), CocoaPods, Rust, Flutter.
- **Linux:** clang, cmake, ninja, pkg-config and GTK 3 via `apt`, `dnf`,
  `pacman` or `zypper` (you'll be asked for your password), Rust, Flutter.

The first run downloads several GB of tools and can take 20–40 minutes.
Later runs take about a minute.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Set up if needed, build, open Where |
| `update` | Get the latest code from GitHub first |
| `cli` | Build and open the command-line version |

e.g. `start-where.bat update` or `bash start-where.sh update`.

If something goes wrong, the script shows the last lines of its log:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\where-tools\setup-log.txt` on Windows,
`~/.where-tools/setup-log.txt` on Mac and Linux.

### Developer builds (no setup, just build)

If your toolchain is already installed and you only want the release files:

| Your computer | Script |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `build-windows.bat` → `dist\v<ver>\` portable zip + installer |
| **Mac** | `bash build-macos.sh` → `dist/v<ver>/` dmg + zip |
| **Linux** | `bash build-linux.sh` → `dist/v<ver>/` AppImage + deb + tar.gz |

### Publishing a release

1. Write the notes in `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` (first line `# Title` becomes
   the release name). Without a file, the CHANGELOG section is used.
2. Bump the version in `Cargo.toml` (workspace) and `apps/where_flutter/pubspec.yaml`.
3. Push to `main`, then push a tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "…"` and
   `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. GitHub builds the Windows, Mac and Linux downloads on its own machines and
   publishes the Release. See
   [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

**By hand (Windows):** double-click **`make-release.bat`**. It zips the app
you built with `start-where.bat`, builds the installer, adds the browser
extension and anything in `release-files\` (e.g. a Mac `.dmg` or Linux
`.AppImage` built on those computers), and creates or updates the GitHub
Release with the notes from `docs/releases/`. `make-release.bat -Fetch` also
pulls in the Mac and Linux files GitHub built for that tag; `-Draft` publishes
a draft first.

## Save links from your browser

1. In Chrome, Edge or Brave, open the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`)
   and turn on **Developer mode**.
2. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the `browser-extension` folder. After
   running `start-where.bat` there's also a copy next to `Where.exe`.
3. Pin the Where button, click it on any page, then **Connect** and
   **Allow** in Where.

The extension only talks to Where on your own computer. Details in
[browser-extension/README.md](browser-extension/README.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl K` | Quick actions and search |
| `Ctrl 1` – `Ctrl 6` | Home, Projects, Tasks, Notes, Links, Files |
| `Alt+Shift+W` (browser) | Save the current page to Where |
| `Ctrl ,` | Settings |
| `↑` `↓` `Enter` | Move through results and open |
| `Esc` | Close a dialog |

## Command line

```sh
where-cli demo                                   # the spec §39 example
where-cli add project Website
where-cli add task "Fix Firebase authentication" -p Website
where-cli index ~/Documents/website -p Website
where-cli search website auth
where-cli show Website
where-cli export -f md where.md
```

Run from source with `cargo run -p where_cli -- <command>`. The tool is named
`where-cli` because plain `where` clashes with Windows' built-in `where.exe`.

## How it works

```
apps/where_flutter ──dart:ffi──► where_ffi ──► where_search ──► where_storage (SQLite + FTS5)
                                                     ▲                  ▲
                          where_cli ─────────────────┘      where_indexer ┘
                                                     all built on where_core
```

| Folder | What's inside |
|---|---|
| `apps/where_flutter/` | The desktop app (Flutter) |
| `crates/where_core/` | Objects and relationships |
| `crates/where_storage/` | SQLite storage, full-text index, export |
| `crates/where_search/` | Query parsing, ranking, relationship-aware matching |
| `crates/where_indexer/` | Opt-in folder indexing |
| `crates/where_ffi/` | The bridge between the app and the engine |
| `crates/where_cli/` | Command-line tool |
| `browser-extension/` | Save pages from Chrome, Edge or Brave |
| `scripts/` | Packaging for Mac/Linux (`package.sh`), Windows release helper (`make-release.ps1`) |
| `build-windows.bat` / `build-macos.sh` / `build-linux.sh` | Developer build scripts — produce release files without setup steps |
| `installer/` | Windows installer (Inno Setup) |
| `docs/` | [Product spec](docs/SPEC.md) and [architecture decisions](docs/adr/) |

## Status

**v0.7.0 — alpha.** Windows, Mac and Linux, with installers. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

| Spec §38 question | Status |
|---|---|
| Can Where index a folder you choose? | ✅ |
| Can it store objects locally? | ✅ |
| Can it search them quickly? | ✅ sub-millisecond on small sets |
| Can objects be connected? | ✅ |
| Can results be shown clearly and quickly? | ✅ desktop app ships on all three platforms |

**Next up:** search speed benchmark (100k objects, p95 < 50 ms), global
Ctrl+Space shortcut, linking notes to files and people. Later: sync,
integrations (GitHub, Google Drive, calendar), optional AI search, plugins.
